### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shreyas Ramakrishna! I graduated in 2022 with a PhD degree in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/). I was advised by Professor [Abhishek Dubey](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/abhishek-dubey), and I work at [SCOPE Lab](https://scopelab.ai/index.html), which is located in [Institute for Software Integrated Systems](https://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/). My research was funded by the [DARPA Assured Autonomy](https://www.darpa.mil/program/assured-autonomy) project.

My research interests include Cyber-Physical Systems, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Safety and Risk assessment. You can learn more about my research and projects on my [personal website](https://www.shreyasramakrishna.com/)
